const aboutText = `
Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! *nl 
I'm Yonatan, an ambitious fullstack developer and UX enthusiast. I love coding 
and I'm always excited to learn more about its multiple facets. *nl 

I began coding back in 2017 when I've trained as a fullstack both at John Bryce 
college and on my own - independently broadening my skills. As a coder you'll 
find me efficient, concise and resourceful as well as a very quick learner. *nl 

At the moment I endeavor to work fulltime as a fullstack, though I'm also open to hear about 
other interesting projects and possibly engage in them as a freelancer. *nl 

Please take a look around, check out any of my demo web-apps and feel free to contact 
me regarding any topic.
